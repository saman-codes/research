**Problem:**

Existing ITI translation methods require paired images

**Solution:**

Introduce a cycle-consistency loss term that allows training without paired images, by minimising the reconstruction error from the output image to the input image. Since the translation $G: X \rightarrow Y$ is underconstrained (i.e. there are infinitely many mappings $G$ that will induce a transformation $X \rightarrow Y$ ), it adds a constraint on the inverse transform $F: Y \rightarrow X$ such that $F(G(X)) \approx X$ and $G(F(Y) \approx Y$. The Cycle-consistency loss, first introduced here, enforces this constraint.

**Architecture:**

Total loss includes both adversarial loss and cycle-consistency loss
