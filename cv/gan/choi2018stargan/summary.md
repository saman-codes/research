**Problem:**

Translating images between *k* domains requires training *k(k-1)* generators:
- this is inefficient
- each generator has access to data between only two domains, so global features (e.g. face shapes) cannot be used efficiently

**Solution:**

Translate between *k* domains using a single generator and discriminator. 

**Results:**

**Architecture:**
