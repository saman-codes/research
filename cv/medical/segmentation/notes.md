Transformations:
(from: Trucco et al. 2019 Computational Retinal Image Analysis, MICCAI)
- "A common preprocessing is flattening of the B-scan, by identifying the Bruchâ€™s membrane and rolling each A-scan to a predetermined vertical position"
- rolling using a parabola
- rotation around the center
- changes in illumination
- vertical and horizontal translation
- scale changes
- horizontal flip
- mild shearing
- additive noise and Gaussian blur.
