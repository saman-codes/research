- RL with Mutual Information (kevin + vince):
  - For semantic segmentation (see [ji_et_al_2019](../cv/unsupervised/ji_et_al_2019/summary.mds))
  - To augment reward signal, curiosity-like

- RL for semantic segmentation (Vince)
  - Single RL model to learn object segmentation and policy

- Update DSRL dissertation (Vince)
  - add a separate curiosity-like prediction task for each heuristic, to augment the reward signal
